Public: As the user interacts with the draft, changes are accumulated in the
DraftChangeSet associated with the store proxy. The DraftChangeSet does two things:

1. It debounces changes and calls Actions.saveDraft() at a reasonable interval.

2. It exposes `applyToModel`, which allows you to optimistically apply changes
  to a draft object. When the proxy vends the draft, it passes it through this
  function to apply uncommitted changes. This means the Draft provided by the
  DraftStoreProxy will always relfect recent changes, even though they're
  written to the database intermittently.

Public: DraftStoreProxy is a small class that makes it easy to implement components
that display Draft objects or allow for interactive editing of Drafts.

1. It synchronously provides an instance of a draft via `draft()`, and
   triggers whenever that draft instance has changed.

2. It provides an interface for modifying the draft that transparently
   batches changes, and ensures that the draft provided via `draft()`
   always has pending changes applied.
