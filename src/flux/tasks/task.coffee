# Public: Tasks are a robust way to handle any mutating changes that need
# to interface with a remote API.
#
# Tasks help you handle and encapsulate optimistic updates, rollbacks,
# undo/redo, API responses, API errors, queuing, and multi-step
# dependencies.
#
# They are especially useful in offline mode. Users may have taken tons of
# actions that we've queued up to process when they come back online.
#
# Tasks represent individual changes to the datastore that alter the local
# cache and need to be synced back to the server.
#
# To create your own task, subclass Task and implement the following
# required methods:
#
# - {Task::performLocal}
# - {Task::performRemote}
#
# See their usage in the documentation below.
#
# ## Task Dependencies
#
# The Task system handles dependencies between multiple queued tasks. For
# example, the {SendDraftTask} has a dependency on the {SyncbackDraftTask}
# (aka saving) succeeding. To establish dependencies between tasks, your
# subclass may implement one or more of the following methods:
#
# - {Task::isDependentOnTask}
# - {Task::onDependentTaskError}
# - {Task::shouldDequeueOtherTask}
#
# ## Undo / Redo
#
# The Task system also supports undo/redo handling. Your subclass must
# implement the following methods to enable this:
#
# - {Task::isUndo}
# - {Task::canBeUndone}
# - {Task::createUndoTask}
# - {Task::createIdenticalTask}
#
# ## Offline Considerations
#
# All tasks should gracefully handle the case when there is no network
# connection.
#
# If we're offline the common behavior is for a task to:
#
# 1. Perform its local change
# 2. Attempt the remote request and get a timeout or offline code
# 3. Have `performRemote` resolve a `Task.Status.Retry`
# 3. Sit queued up waiting to be retried
# 4. Wait for {Actions::longPollConnected} to restart the {TaskQueue}
#
# Remember that a user may be offline for hours and perform thousands of
# tasks in the meantime. It's important that your tasks implement
# `shouldDequeueOtherTask` and `isDependentOnTask` to make sure ordering
# always remains correct.
#
# ## Serialization and Window Considerations
#
# The whole {TaskQueue} and all of its Tasks are serialized and stored in
# the Database. This allows the {TaskQueue} to work across windows and
# ensures we don't lose any pending tasks if a user is offline for a while
# and quits and relaunches the application.
#
# All instance variables you create must be able to be serialized to a
# JSON string and re-inflated. Notably, **`function` objects will not be
# properly re-inflated**.
#
# If you have instance variables that are instances of core {Model}
# classes or {Task} classes, they will be automatically re-inflated to the
# correct class via {Utils::deserializeRegisteredObject}. If you create
# your own custom classes, they must be registered once per window via
# {TaskRegistry::register}
#
# ## Example Task
#
# **Task Definition**:
#
# ```coffee
# _ = require 'underscore'
# request = require 'request'
# {Task, DatabaseStore} = require('nylas-exports')
#
# class UpdateTodoTask extends Task
#   constructor: (@existingTodo, @newData) ->
#     super
#
#   performLocal: ->
#     @updatedTodo = _.extend(_.clone(@existingTodo), @newData)
#     return DatabaseStore.persistModel(@updatedTodo)
#
#   performRemote: ->
#     new Promise (resolve, reject) =>
#       options = {url: "https://myapi.co", method: 'PUT', json: @newData}
#       request options, (error, response, body) ->
#         if error then resolve(Task.Status.Failed)
#         else resolve(Task.Status.Success)
#
# module.exports = UpdateTodoTask
# ```
#
# **Task Usage**:
#
# ```coffee
# {Actions} = require('nylas-exports')
# UpdateTodoTask = require('./update-todo-task')
#
# someMethod: ->
#   ...
#
#   task = new UpdateTodoTask(existingTodo, name: "Test")
#   Actions.queueTask(task)
#
#   ...
#
# ```
#
# This example `UpdateTodoTask` does not handle undo/redo, nor does it
# rollback the changes if there's an API error. See examples in
# {Task::performLocal} for ideas on how to handle this.

  ##### REQUIRED METHODS #####

  # Public: **Required** | Override to perform local, optimistic updates.
  #
  # Most tasks will put code in here that updates the {DatabaseStore}
  #
  # You should also implement the rollback behavior inside of
  # `performLocal` or in some helper method. It's common practice (but not
  # automatic) for `performLocal` to be re-called at the end of an API
  # failure from `performRemote`.
  #
  # That rollback behavior is also likely the same when you want to undo a
  # task. It's common practice (but not automatic) for `createUndoTask` to
  # set some flag that `performLocal` will recognize to implement the
  # rollback behavior.
  #
  # `performLocal` will complete BEFORE the task actually enters the
  # {TaskQueue}.
  #
  # If you would like to do work after `performLocal` has run, you can use
  # {TaskQueueStatusStore::waitForPerformLocal}. Pass it the task and it
  # will return a Promise that resolves once the local action has
  # completed. This is contained in the {TaskQueueStatusStore} so you can
  # listen to tasks across windows.
  #
  # ## Examples
  #
  # ### Simple Optimistic Updating
  #
  # ```coffee
  # class MyTask extends Task
  #   performLocal: ->
  #     @updatedModel = @_myModelUpdateCode()
  #     return DatabaseStore.persistModel(@updatedModel)
  # ```
  #
  # ### Handling rollback on API failure
  #
  # ```coffee
  # class MyTask extends Task
  #   performLocal: ->
  #     if @_reverting
  #       @updatedModel = @_myModelRollbackCode()
  #     else
  #       @updatedModel = @_myModelUpdateCode()
  #     return DatabaseStore.persistModel(@updatedModel)
  #
  #   performRemote: ->
  #     @_APIPutHelperMethod(@updatedModel).catch (apiError) =>
  #       if apiError.statusCode is 500
  #         @_reverting = true
  #         @performLocal()
  # ```
  #
  # ### Handling an undo task
  #
  # ```coffee
  # class MyTask extends Task
  #   performLocal: ->
  #     if @_isUndoTask
  #       @updatedModel = @_myModelRollbackCode()
  #     else
  #       @updatedModel = @_myModelUpdateCode()
  #     return DatabaseStore.persistModel(@updatedModel)
  #
  #   createUndoTask: ->
  #     undoTask = @createIdenticalTask()
  #     undoTask._isUndoTask = true
  #     return undoTask
  # ```
  #
  # Also see the documentation on the required undo methods
  #
  # Returns a {Promise} that resolves when your updates are complete.
  performLocal: ->
    Promise.resolve()

  # Public: **Required** | Put the actual API request code here.
  #
  # You must return a {Promise} that resolves to one of the following
  # status constants:
  #
  #   - `Task.Status.Success`
  #   - `Task.Status.Retry`
  #   - `Task.Status.Continue`
  #   - `Task.Status.Failed`
  #
  # The resolved status will determine what the {TaskQueue} does with this
  # task when it is finished.
  #
  # This is where you should put your actual API code. You can use the
  # node `request` library to easily hit APIs, or use the {NylasAPI} class
  # to talk to the [Nylas Platform API](https://nylas.com/docs).
  #
  # Here is a more detailed explanation of Task Statuses:
  #
  # ### Task.Status.Success
  #
  # Resolve to `Task.Status.Success` when the task successfully completes.
  # Once done, the task will be dequeued and logged as a success.
  #
  # ### Task.Status.Retry
  #
  # If you resolve `Task.Status.Retry`, the task will remain on the queue
  # and tried again later. Any other task dependent on the current one
  # will also continue waiting.
  #
  # The queue is re-processed whenever a new task is enqueued, dequeued,
  # or the internet connection comes back online via
  # {Actions::longPollConnected}.
  #
  # `Task.Status.Retry` is useful if it looks like we're offline, or you
  # get an API error code that indicates temporary failure.
  #
  # ### Task.Status.Continue
  #
  # Resolving `Task.Status.Continue` will silently dequeue the task, allow
  # dependent tasks through, but not mark it as successfully resolved.
  #
  # This is useful if you get permanent API errors, but don't really care
  # if the task failed.
  #
  # ### Task.Status.Failed
  #
  # If you catch a permanent API error code (like a 500), or something
  # else goes wrong then resolve to `Task.Status.Failed`.
  #
  # Resolving `Task.Status.Failed` will dequeue this task, and **dequeue
  # all dependent tasks**.
  #
  # You can optionally return the error object itself for debugging
  # purposes by resolving an array of the form: `[Task.Status.Failed,
  # errorObject]`
  #
  # You should not `throw` exceptions. Catch all cases yourself and
  # determine which `Task.Status` to resolve to. If due to programmer
  # error an exception is thrown, our {TaskQueue} will catch it, log it,
  # and deal with the task as if it resolved `Task.Status.Failed`.
  #
  # Returns a {Promise} that resolves to a valid `Task.Status` type.
  performRemote: ->
    Promise.resolve(Task.Status.Success)


  ##### DEPENDENCY METHODS #####

  # Public: determines which other tasks this one is dependent on.
  #
  # - `other` An instance of a {Task} you must test to see if it's a
  # dependency of this one.
  #
  # Any task that passes the truth test will be considered a "dependency".
  #
  # If a "dependency" has a `Task.Status.Failed`, then all downstream
  # tasks will get dequeued recursively.
  #
  # A task will also never be run at the same time as one of its
  # dependencies.
  #
  # Returns `true` (is dependent on) or `false` (is not dependent on)
  isDependentOnTask: (other) -> false

  # Public: determines which other tasks this one should dequeue when
  # it is first queued.
  #
  # - `other` An instance of a {Task} you must test to see if it's now
  # obsolete.
  #
  # Any task that passes the truth test will be considered "obsolete" and
  # dequeued immediately.
  #
  # This is particularly useful in offline mode. Users may queue up tons
  # of tasks but when we come back online to process them, we only want to
  # process the latest one.
  #
  # Returns `true` (should dequeue) or `false` (should not dequeue)
  shouldDequeueOtherTask: (other) -> false

  onDependentTaskError: (other, error) ->

  ##### UNDO / REDO METHODS #####

  # Public: It's up to you to determine how you want to indicate whether
  # or not you have an instance of an "Undo Task". We commonly use a
  # simple instance variable boolean flag.
  #
  # Returns `true` (is an Undo Task) or `false` (is not an Undo Task)
  isUndo: -> false

  # Public: Determines whether or not this task can be undone via the
  # {UndoRedoStore}
  #
  # Returns `true` (can be undone) or `false` (can't be undone)
  canBeUndone: -> false

  # Public: Return from `createIdenticalTask` and set a flag so your
  # `performLocal` and `performRemote` methods know that this is an undo
  # task.
  createUndoTask: -> throw new Error("Unimplemented")

  # Public: Return a deep-cloned task to be used for an undo task
  createIdenticalTask: ->
    json = @toJSON()
    delete json['queueState']
    (new @.constructor).fromJSON(json)


  ##### OTHER METHODS #####

  # Public: code to run if someone tries to dequeue your task while it is
  # in flight.
  #
  cancel: ->

  # Public: (optional) A string displayed to users when your task is run.
  #
  # When tasks are run, we automatically display a notification to users
  # of the form "label (numberOfImpactedItems)". If this does not a return
  # a string, no notification is displayed
  label: ->

  # Public: A string displayed to users indicating how many items your
  # task affected.
  numberOfImpactedItems: ->
    1

  # Private: Allows for serialization of tasks
  toJSON: ->
    @

  # Private: Allows for deserialization of tasks
  fromJSON: (json) ->
    for key,val of json
      @[key] = val
    @
