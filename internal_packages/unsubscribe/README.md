![Unsubscribe: unsubscribe without leaving N1](plugin.png)

Quickly unsubscribe from emails without leaving N1. The unsubscribe plugin parses the `list-unsubscribe` header and the email body to look for the best way to unsubscribe. If an unsubscribe email address can be found, the plugin will send one in the background on your behalf. If only a browser link is found, either a mini N1 browser window will open or for certain cases, you will be redirected to your default browser.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Press <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>U</kbd> when viewing an email. This shortcut can be changed in the preference panel (`Nylas->Preferences->Unsubscribe`).

## Reporting Bugs

- **Feature Requests or Bug Reports**: Submit them through the [issues](issues) pane.
