# Github Contact Card Section

Extends the contact card in the sidebar to show public repos of the people you email.
Uses GitHub's public API to look up a GitHub user based on their email address,
and then displays public repos and their stars.

This example is a good starting point for plugins that want to display data from
external sources in the sidebar. If you want to see some more advanced plugins, have a look through [all the internal plugins, here on Github](https://github.com/nylas/nylas-mail/tree/master/internal_packages).
